The Legend of Quake 2 is a mod that was created by incorperating the Legend of Zelda and Quake 2 into one game. The goal was to add the aspects of The
Legend of Zelda into Quake 2 such as enemies dropping items like rupees, replacing the Quake 2 weapons with Link's weapons, adding a shop keeper where
the player can buy items such as weapon upgrades and armor/tunic sets with different properties. For this mod though these features were not added. The
help screen has been updated.
